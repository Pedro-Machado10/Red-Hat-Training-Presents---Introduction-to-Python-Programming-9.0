The solution files for these exercises are in the AD141-apps repository, within the json/solutions directory.

Exercise 1
Create a program that reads books.json.

Prompt the user to enter a book title until they decide to quit.

If the title is in the JSON data, print the data for that book.

If the book is not in the JSON data, the program must indicate it.

Sample output:

Enter the title of a book (q to quit): Odyssey
Odyssey Info:
  year: 800
  pages: 374
  language: Greek
  author: Homer
  country: Greece
Exercise 2
Write a program that saves a dictionary as a JSON file.

The dictionary should contain the word frequency (words as keys, frequency as values) read from the cyclone file.

When saving the JSON file, the indentation level should be tab characters.

The program should display the word that appeared most often in the file.

Sample output:

'the' occurred 93 times
Exercise 3
Retrieve and operate on tasks from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos.

Get the task list as JSON from the preceding API URL.

Save the data to two local files, one that contains completed tasks and another one that contains incomplete tasks.

The JSON data written to the files should be formatted as minimally as possible (no spaces, newlines, etc).

The program should display the number of tasks we have completed. Sample output:

90 of 200 tasks are done
Exercise 4
The following API endpoint returns JSON data that contains a random trivia fact about a number sent to it: http://numbersapi.com/a_number/?json&notfound=floor.

Write a program that makes an HTTP request to the API.

The program should display the fact that was returned in the JSON data.

Another endpoint will return mathematical data about a number:

http://numbersapi.com/a_number/math/?json&notfound=floor

sending request http://numbersapi.com/42/?json&notfound=floor...
42 is the result given by the web search engines Google, Wolfram Alpha and Bing when the query \"the answer to life the universe and everything\" is entered as a search.
