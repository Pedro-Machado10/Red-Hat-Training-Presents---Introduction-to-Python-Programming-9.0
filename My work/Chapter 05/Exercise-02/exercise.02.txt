Exercise 2
Create a new file and define a function in it with the same name (but different behavior) as one of the functions from the previous exercise.

In a separate file, create an application that imports the module from this exercise that contains the function and the module from the previous exercise.

The application should be able to successfully call all of the functions from both of the imported modules.
